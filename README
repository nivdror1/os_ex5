##### Q1 #####

a)
First, we need to add another input possibility in handleRequestFromUser function to recognize
"leave_group" command. Second, we need to add a parsing function that split the message and make
sure all the arguments are valid (which means groupName is alphaNumeric and that there is no more
 arguments).
 After we make sure that the input is valid, we will send "leave_group groupName" to the server
 and that's it.

b)
First, we will split the message and make sure that the sender client is part of group groupName.
Second, we will get the vector of group members for this group name from groupNameToClients and
remove this specific client from this vector, if the vector is empty we will remove this group
from groupNameToClients map. Last, will get the vector of groups that this client is part of them
 from clientsToGroups and remove this specific group name from this vector.


##### Q2 #####
We prefer TCP because of that big advantages:

1) TCP protocol is reliable, that means that every message we send we can know for sure that it
will send only once and transfers completely - critical property when you build whataspp like
program.

2) TCP protocol is connection oriented, which means that the client can know if his message gets
to it's destination - it is important because otherwise he cannot know if he need to send it again.


##### Q3 #####
Two examples of us for applications that use UDP:

1) Online games - The connection between the players and the game ,
must be fast in order to create responsive game experience.

2) Video Chat - In a video chat, the image and sound must be synchronized and continuously,
therefore UDP is more effective in these form of applications.

##### Q4 #####
Firstly, in order to create a system that recovers from server crash we would create a log.
Now instead using std::cout we would have written the messages to the log file.
Hence, on a event of a server crash we could recover the conversations and the rest of the output.

Secondly, we would backup the server data structures so we can know which client was connected
and which group was created.

Of course we will lose the information that was parsed by the client and not yet send to the
server, and also the what was processed by the server at the time of the crash.
